# Frontend:
# react

# backend:
# node
# node js through AWS communication
# to save cost we did not integrate with frontned
# communication happens through nodjs

# Updates are through rest API's for the frontend to be consumed
# AWS keeps on updating frequently every minute through node we have written a process for everyday like we are writting a CRON job to specify when the job should run we have written a service there also in CRON job
# through this we are getting the realtime data for it
# the data is being saved in mongo db and through REST API's we are getting the data and consuming them in the front end.
